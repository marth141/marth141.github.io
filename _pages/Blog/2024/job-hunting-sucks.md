2024 has seen some horrible layoffs especially in the technology market and boy howdy it sucks. So here is a rant on my 2024 job hunt.

# Rant on 2024's Job Hunt
---
Well, it's quite unfortunate but in December of 2023 I got laid off and received the lovely privilege of being promoted to possible future customer with my former employer.

Now why did this happen?

Well I'd definitely accept that there is probably some of my own personal responsibility involved however the company did admit it is a layoff, so they are admitting their own fault. Solar companies are incredibly sensitive to changing economics and in 2024, interest rates got hiked up more. For those who haven't bought a solar panel system before, you're likely taking out a loan to purchase it. These loans of course are going to have interest rates and of course, they've been raised an amount substantial enough that during 2023 the company had 40% less sales than they had expected.

Pretty unfortunate for everyone involved if we're being honest. Now the main point of my writing is to rant about how the job market just sucks.

I have heard some word from friends that this is probably the worst job market since 2008--which although I wasn't in the workforce at the time, I understand that it was a horrible time for everyone who was, especially those who were homeowners.

So why exactly has this job market sucked?

It's been bad because there isn't an abundance of hiring jobs. The technology industry in The United States had let go of a lot of technology workers which had significantly increased the amount of competition in the industry.

Now that just means that you have to get good and that I haven't gotten a job yet clearly signals to me, "Skill Issue" however I've also been told that this is just a normal amount of time to be looking for a job.

Is there anything that'll make things better? At this point, I really don't think so. One will see that during the pandemic, a lot of companies had begun growing a ton. This all looked good on paper but it was all synthetic and fake. These companies were growing because they were accepting a ton of COVID relief money and using that money to grow. Once the money tap was shut off, these companies had to scale back operations significantly and that included letting go a lot of good people.

If you're out there working on the job hunt, I'm sorry. I understand your struggle and I think we're going to make it. However, we might have to take up jobs that we don't want to be able to survive for an amount of time. Consider yourself lucky if you're able to collect unemployment insurance. Luckier still if you don't have a lot of bills to pay such as a mortgage or child care.

Everyone out there looking for jobs right now should continue grinding and bettering their skills in whatever category they're in. Although I've been told that certifications are a waste of time, they're probably worth considering to acquire in this time because it certainly helps one to stand out in the sea of competition--and the competition is fierce.

Don't forget to also take care of your physical health. There is a real mind-body connection where if you're taking care of your body by getting physical activity, taking omega3s and ashwagandha, then you might just make it. This has been my strategy for the last while and it seems to be quite helpful.

Good luck out there everyone. I wish you all the best. We're going to make it.
